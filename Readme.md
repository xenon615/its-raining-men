# It’s Raining Men
Sketch inspired by the song of the same name by the group "THE WEATHER GIRLS" and the desire to deepen my knowledge of Bevy Engine.  
I hope that in pursuing my goals I have not violated anyone's rights, have not offended anyone's feelings and have not served as a bad example :) .  
As for the code itself, it's still far from ideal, of course. I studied different things, then applied different things, and in the end I just had fun.  
If anyone finds any of this useful, feel free to use it. If anyone wants to point out my mistakes or suggest better ways, I will accept it with gratitude and will use it (most likely in future projects)
